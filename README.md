# VBA-Stock-Analysis

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective

The VBA file in this repository can be used to analyize yearly stock data.  It calculates the stock price change for the year, the price percent change for the year, and the total volume traded for that year.  It will then sort through the calculated data and determine the best performer, the worst performer, and the stock with the greatest volume traded for the year.  If you have a workbook with multiple sheets divided by years this script will cycle through each sheet automatically.

### Technologies
* Excel
* VBA

### Instructions:
To use the script your data needs to be formatted like the excel screenshots attached in the repository.  This is to ensure that when the script runs, it grabs the correct values.  If your data is formatted differently, you will need to either change the format of your data or adjust the script so it is grabbing the correct values. Once your data is formatted, go ahead and insert the vba script into excel and run it.  It should output the data like the attached screenshots.
