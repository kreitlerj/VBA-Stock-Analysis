# VBA-Stock-Analysis

Purpose: The VBA file in this repository can be used to analyize yearly stock data.  It calculates the stock price change for the year, the price percent change for the year, and the total volume traded for that year.  It will then sort through the calculated data and determine the best performer, the worst performer, and the stock with the greatest volume traded for the year.  If you have a workbook with multiple sheets divided by years this script will cycle through each sheet automatically.
