# VBA-Stock-Analysis

Purpose: The VBA file in this repository was use to analyize yearly stock data.  I calculates the yearly change, percent change for the year, and total volume traded for that year.  It will then sort through the calculated data and determine the best performer, worst performer, and the stock with the greatest volume traded for the year.  If you have a workbook with multiple sheets divided by years this script will cycle through each sheet automatically.
